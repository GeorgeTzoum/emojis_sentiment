emojis sentiment analysis with r

I have used the decoder made by today-is-a-good-day in order to Identify emojis within tweets 
After that I have assigned the probabilities of P. Kralj Novak, J. Smailović, B. Sluban, I. Mozetič paper to each emoji
At the end the output is a  dataframe with the columns representing tweets and raws representing emojis 
when a emoji is present within a tweet  the corresponding cell represents the probability of being positive
